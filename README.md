# Murano Plone Application

[Murano](https://www.mirantis.com/software/application-catalog-murano/) is an [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) project that provides an application catalog, like
the AppStore for iOS or GooglePlay for Android. Murano lets you easily
browse for cloud applications you need by their name or category, and then
enables you to rapidly deploy them to the cloud with just a few clicks.

This repo contains simple example of murano application that installs 
[Plone CMS](https://plone.org/) on top of OpenStack using Murano egine.

Murano Plone Application is written during the following blog post series
where you will find detailed step-by-step guide:
* [**Day 1: What is Murano, and why do I need it?**](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/develop-cloud-applications-for-openstack-on-murano-part-1-what-is-murano-and-why-do-i-need-it/)\
In this article, we’ll talk about what Murano is, who it helps, and how. We’ll also start with the basic concepts you need to understand and let you know what you’ll need for the rest of the series.
* [**Day 2:  Creating the development environment**](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-to-develop-cloud-applications-for-openstack-using-murano-part-2-creating-the-development-environment/)\
In this article, we’ll look at deploying an OpenStack cluster with Murano so that you’ve got the framework to work with.
* [**Day 3:  The application, part 1:  Understanding Plone deployment**](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/develop-cloud-applications-for-openstack-murano-part-3-the-application-part-1-understanding-plone-deployment/)\
In our example, we’ll show you how to use Murano to easily deploy the Plone enterprise CMS; in this article, we’ll go over what Murano will actually have to do to install it.
* [**Day 4:  The application, part 2:  Creating the Murano App**](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/develop-cloud-applications-for-openstack-on-murano-day-4-the-application-part-2-creating-the-murano-app/)\
Next we’ll go ahead and create the actual Murano App that will deploy Plone.
* [**Day 5:  Uploading and troubleshooting the app**](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/develop-cloud-applications-for-openstack-on-murano-day-5-uploading-and-troubleshooting-the-app/)\
Now that we’ve created the Plone Murano App, we’ll go ahead and add it to the application catalog so that users can deploy it. We’ll also look at some common issues and how to solve them.
